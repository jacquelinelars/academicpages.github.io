I am an Assistant Professor of Spanish Linguistics in the Department of Modern and Classical Languages. My research focuses on various aspects of language contact – including loanwords, code-switching, and calques – and draws from multiple disciplines and linguistic subfields including corpus linguistics, computational linguistics, sociolinguistics, semantics, and statistics. She has several publications on Spanish and English contact using large datasets. In collaborating with the external research group, [Bilingual Annotation Task force] (http://sites.utexas.edu/bats/), I develop computational methods, metrics and visualizations to analyze mixed language corpora.
